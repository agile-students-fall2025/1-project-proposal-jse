# Project Title  
StrideAI  

# What and Why?  
We propose building **StrideAI**, an AI-powered running coaching application that brings the training philosophies and routines of professional and Olympic-level athletes to everyday runners. We want to market it as a way to give access to world class training to every day people. AI will be used to personalize generic training plans to the specific runner based on current running data. 

The problem we’re solving is that high-quality, personalized coaching is expensive and inaccessible to most recreational and semi-competitive runners. Professional athletes train with dedicated coaches, sports scientists, and nutritionists, but average runners rely on generic training plans from books, blogs, or free apps.  

# For Whom?  
The primary end-users are:  
- Amateur and recreational runners training for events such as 5Ks, 10Ks, half-marathons, and marathons.  
- College students and young professionals who want structured training but cannot afford a personal coach and have poor current coaching.  
- High school and collegiate athletes who want supplementary training advice inspired by elite runners.  

# How?  
From the end-user’s perspective, **StrideAI** will function as a personal AI running coach, featuring “virtual versions” of professional athletes whose public training data, interviews, and routines inform the coaching engine.  

Key features: 
- Virtual AI Coaches: Users can pick from AI personas modeled after pro athletes (e.g., a marathoner, sprinter, or middle-distance runner).  
- Personalized Training Plans: The app adapts elite-level workouts to the user’s fitness, weekly mileage, and race goals.  
- Dynamic Adjustments: Plans evolve based on performance data (pace, heart rate, RPE, GPS), making it feel like the athlete-coach is giving real-time feedback.  
- Motivational Interactions: Users can “chat” with their AI coach for encouragement, recovery advice, and training rationale.  
- Progress Tracking: Visual dashboards to show weekly mileage, VO₂ max trends, injury risk, and upcoming races.
- Social networking: Application can suggest nearby runnings who are following a similar trainnig plan to run with.   

# Scope  
This project requires integrating multiple components, ranging from AI persona generation, training plan logic, user profile management, and a clean mobile/web interface.  

We believe that this is not overly ambitious, as we can limit the scope to:  
- 1–2 AI athlete-coaches.  
- A single race distance (e.g., 5K/10K).  
- Basic wearable integration.
- Integration with exisiting data collectors (Garmin/Coros) through APIs. 

By semester’s end, a working prototype should allow a user to sign up, select a coach, receive a personalized plan, and interact with their AI coach as they progress.
